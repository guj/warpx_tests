# warpx_tests
These are the test setups I used for warps runs as of May 2025. 
Includes are the input files and the scripts. 


Please add links to the following:
- bpls (adios)
- EXE (warpx)
at this dir.

And then "ls ." should contain three items: 
- bpls -> /link/to/actual/
- EXE -> /link/to/actual/
- inputs_3d/
